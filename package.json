    "description": "The Miataru API is very simple and straight forward. Generally you're posting (HTTP POST) a JSON formatted request to a service method locations and you get back a JSON formatted answer. Please take into consideration that this has the request-for-comment status and that it can change while there's work done on client and server applications. Versioning therefore is done by prepending the version number - /v1/ for version 1 - to the method call.",
